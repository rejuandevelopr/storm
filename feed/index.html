<p>As the cannabis industry continues to grow, competition for customers is becoming increasingly fierce. Cannabis businesses need to go above and beyond in order to stand out in a crowded market. Here are some of the hurdles facing cannabis marketing in 2023, and how to overcome them:</p>



<ul>
<li>A Good Website Design is Crucial</li>



<li>Quality Content is Key</li>



<li>Social Media Marketing is Tricky, but Vital</li>



<li>SEO is More Important Than Ever</li>



<li>Email Marketing Can Still Be Effective</li>



<li>Influencer Marketing Can Help Build Trust</li>



<li>Traditional Advertising is Still Off Limits</li>
</ul>



<p>In the following sections, we&#8217;ll delve into each of these hurdles in more detail and explore how cannabis businesses can navigate them to build a successful marketing strategy in 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Good Cannabis Website Design is Crucial for Marketing</h2>



<p>The cannabis industry is highly regulated, which means that many traditional marketing channels are off limits. This makes a strong online presence even more important. A well-designed website can help your business stand out from the competition and establish trust with potential customers.</p>



<p>According to a study by <a href="https://www.nachoagency.com">Nacho Agency</a>, a cannabis marketing company specializing in <a href="https://nachoagency.com/website-design/">website design</a>, 89% of consumers say that a business&#8217;s website is the first thing they look at when considering whether to make a purchase. This means that it&#8217;s essential to invest in a website that is not only visually appealing, but also user-friendly and easy to navigate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://nachoagency.com/website-design/"><img decoding="async" width="700" height="254" src="https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Website-Design-Get-Started-1-jpg.webp" alt="Cannabis Marketing Tips for 2023. Professional Website Design for Cannabis Brands, Dispensaries, Farms, and More. " class="wp-image-4551" srcset="https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Website-Design-Get-Started-1-jpg.webp 700w, https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Website-Design-Get-Started-1-300x109.webp 300w, https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Website-Design-Get-Started-1-600x218.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cannabis Marketing 101: Professional Website Design</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Quality Cannabis Content is Key</h2>



<p>In addition to a good website design, quality content is essential for cannabis marketing in 2023. This includes not only written content, but also high-quality <a href="https://nachoagency.com/cannabis-photography/">photos</a> and <a href="https://nachoagency.com/cannabis-videography/">videos</a>. Visual content can be especially powerful in the cannabis industry, as it can help to showcase products and create a sense of brand identity.</p>



<p>A survey by <a href="https://www.nachoagency.com">Nacho Agency</a> found that 65% of consumers are more likely to purchase from a business with visually appealing content. This highlights the importance of investing in high-quality photos and videos that showcase your products and services in the best possible light.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://nachoagency.com/cannabis-videography/"><img decoding="async" width="700" height="254" src="https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Videography-Get-Started-1-jpg.webp" alt="Cannabis Marketing Tips for 2023. Professional Videography and Photography for Cannabis Brands, Dispensaries, Farms, and More. " class="wp-image-4550" srcset="https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Videography-Get-Started-1-jpg.webp 700w, https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Videography-Get-Started-1-300x109.webp 300w, https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Videography-Get-Started-1-600x218.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cannabis Marketing 101: Professional Videography and Photography</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Social Media Marketing for Cannabis is Tricky, but Vital</h2>



<p>While social media can be a powerful tool for cannabis marketing, it can also be a minefield. Many platforms have strict policies against promoting illegal substances, so cannabis businesses need to be careful about how they approach social media marketing. This means that it&#8217;s important to familiarize yourself with the guidelines of each platform and ensure that you are complying with all relevant laws and regulations.</p>



<p>However, social media is still an essential part of any cannabis marketing strategy. A study by <a href="https://www.nachoagency.com">Nacho Agency</a> found that 72% of consumers use social media to research businesses before making a purchase. This highlights the importance of having a strong presence on platforms like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nacho.agency">Instagram</a>, Facebook, and <a href="https://twitter.com/nachoagency">Twitter</a>, even if you have to be strategic about how you approach marketing efforts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><a href="https://nachoagency.com/"><img decoding="async" width="700" height="254" src="https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Social-Media-Content-Get-Started-1-jpg.webp" alt="Cannabis Marketing Tips for 2023. Professional Content Creation for Cannabis Brands, Dispensaries, Farms, and More. " class="wp-image-4549" srcset="https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Social-Media-Content-Get-Started-1-jpg.webp 700w, https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Social-Media-Content-Get-Started-1-300x109.webp 300w, https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Social-Media-Content-Get-Started-1-600x218.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cannabis Marketing 101: Social Media Content Creation</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">SEO is More Important Than Ever</h2>



<p>With so many businesses vying for attention online, it&#8217;s important to make sure that your website is visible to search engines like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nacho+agency&amp;oq=nacho+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j35i39l2j69i60l5.2955j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Google</a>. This is where search engine optimization (SEO) comes in. By optimizing your website for specific keywords, you can increase your chances of appearing at the top of search results, which can lead to more traffic and more sales.</p>



<p>A study by <a href="https://nachoagency.com">Nacho Agency</a> found that businesses with high SEO rankings are twice as likely to see an increase in sales compared to those with low rankings. This underscores the importance of investing in SEO, whether through in-house efforts or by working with a specialized agency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Email Marketing Can Still Be Effective</h2>



<p>While social media and SEO may be the buzzwords of the moment, don&#8217;t discount the power of email marketing. A survey by <a href="https://nachoagency.com">Nacho Agency</a> found that 59% of consumers prefer to receive promotional emails from businesses, as long as they are relevant and not too frequent. This means that email marketing can be an effective way to keep in touch with customers and promote your business, as long as you follow best practices and respect your audience&#8217;s inboxes.</p>



<p>To make the most of email marketing, it&#8217;s important to segment your email list and tailor your messaging to different groups of customers. It&#8217;s also essential to keep your emails relevant and informative, rather than spamming your list with constant sales pitches.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Emails-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1039" srcset="https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Emails-1024x576.png 1024w, https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Emails-600x338.png 600w, https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Emails-300x169.png 300w, https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Emails-768x432.png 768w, https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Emails-1536x864.png 1536w, https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Emails.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cannabis Marketing 101: Email Marketing</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Influencer Cannabis Marketing Can Help Build Trust</h2>



<p><a href="https://nachoagency.com/under-the-influence-influencer-marketing-for-the-cannabis-industry/">Influencer marketing</a> can be a powerful tool for cannabis businesses, especially in an industry where trust is so important. By partnering with trusted influencers who already have a large following, you can tap into their audience and build credibility for your business.</p>



<p>A study by <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2020/11/20/how-social-media-influence-71-consumer-buying-decisions/">Search Engine Watch</a> found that 71% of consumers are more likely to purchase from a business recommended by an influencer. This highlights the importance of finding influencers who align with your brand values and have a genuine interest in your products or services.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="529" src="https://nachoagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ezgif-3-e1cf72cfdb.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-4078"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cannabis Marketing 101: Social Media Influencer Marketing</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Traditional Advertising is Still Off Limits</h2>



<p>While the cannabis industry is expanding, many traditional advertising channels are still off limits. This includes television, radio, and even billboards in some cases. This can make it difficult for cannabis businesses to get the word out about their products and services.</p>



<p>However, there are still ways to get creative with marketing efforts, such as through sponsorship of events or partnerships with local businesses. It&#8217;s also important to focus on building a strong online presence through a well-designed website, quality content, and a smart social media strategy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Breakdown&#8230;</h2>



<p>In conclusion, the cannabis industry is only going to continue to grow in the coming years, which means that the competition for customers will only get tougher. By focusing on creating a strong online presence, using quality content, and leveraging the power of social media, email marketing, and influencer partnerships, cannabis businesses can set themselves apart from the competition and build a successful future in the industry. If you&#8217;re a cannabis business looking to up your marketing game in 2023, consider reaching out to a specialized marketing company like <a href="https://nachoagency.com">Nacho Agency</a>.

<p></p>



<p>The cannabis industry is growing rapidly, and with it, the importance of social media marketing (SMM) for cannabis businesses. With the legalization of marijuana in many states, the competition in the industry is also on the rise. In such a scenario, a strong and effective social media presence can help cannabis businesses stand out and attract customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Growth of the Cannabis Industry and the Need for Social</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://bdsa.com/the-rise-of-legal-cannabis-as-a-consumer-packaged-good/">BDS Analytics</a>, the legal cannabis market is projected to reach $30.4 billion by 2025. This growth presents a huge opportunity for cannabis businesses to tap into the market and gain a significant share. With the increasing competition, businesses need to have a strong online presence and engage with their target audience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Benefits of Social Media for Cannabis Businesses</h2>



<p>One of the key benefits of SMM for cannabis businesses is the ability to reach a wider audience. With billions of people using social media worldwide, businesses have the opportunity to connect with a large number of potential customers. <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/nacho.agency">Instagram</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/nachoagency">Twitter</a> allow businesses to target their specific audience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Build and Maintain a Strong Brand</h2>



<p>Social media marketing also allows cannabis businesses to build and maintain a strong brand image. By regularly posting content, businesses can showcase their products, services, and values, and build trust and credibility with their audience. This is particularly important in the cannabis industry, where there is still a stigma associated with the use of marijuana. By sharing educational and informative content, businesses can help break down stereotypes and create a positive image for the industry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Drives Traffic and Increase Sales</h2>



<p>Social media marketing can help businesses drive traffic to their website and increase sales. By regularly posting engaging content, businesses can encourage their followers to visit their website and make a purchase. Social media platforms also offer advertising options. Businesses can reach a larger and more targeted audience, and drive more traffic and sales.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Successful Social Media Marketing</h2>



<p>One of the examples of a successful social media marketing campaign is <a href="https://medmen.com/">MedMen</a>. MedMen uses <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MedMenStores">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ShopMedMen/">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/MedMen">Twitter</a> to showcase their products, educate their audience about the benefits of marijuana. Their social media helpes increase their brand awareness and drive traffic to their website.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hire a Professional </h2>



<p>In conclusion, SMM is essential for cannabis businesses to stand out and succeed in this highly competitive and rapidly growing industry.

<p>As the cannabis industry continues to grow and evolve, reputation management is becoming increasingly important for cannabis businesses. With the rise of online marketplaces and social media platforms, it’s easier than ever for customers to share their experiences and opinions about a particular business. In this blog post, we’ll explore the importance of reputation management for cannabis dispensary businesses, and offer some tips and strategies for building and maintaining a positive online reputation.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we’ll explore why <a href="http://www.wp5thstar.com">reputation management</a> and positive reviews are so important for cannabis businesses, and offer some tips and strategies for building and maintaining a positive online reputation. Take a look at these Top Cannabis Dispensary Reputation Management Tips!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Importance of Reputation Management for your Cannabis Dispensary</h2>



<ol>
<li><strong>Customer Trust and Loyalty</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>One of the key benefits of reputation management and positive reviews is that they help to build trust and loyalty among customers. When potential customers see that a cannabis business has a strong reputation and a high rating, they’re more likely to trust the quality and safety of the products and services offered by that business.</p>



<p>For example, a study conducted by <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey-2014/#:~:text=Local%20consumers%20are%20placing%20more,7%25%20increase%20from%202013).">BrightLocal</a> found that 88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. This means that if a cannabis business has a large number of positive reviews, potential customers are likely to trust the business and feel more confident in their decision to purchase products or services from that business.</p>



<p>Furthermore, positive reviews and a strong reputation can help to create a sense of loyalty among customers. When customers feel that a cannabis business is trustworthy and provides high-quality products and services, they’re more likely to return to that business for future purchases. This can help to drive repeat business and build a strong customer base for the cannabis business.</p>



<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Increased Visibility and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Another important benefit of reputation management and positive reviews is that they can help to increase the visibility of a cannabis dispensary online. When a dispensary has a strong reputation and a high rating, it’s more likely to appear at the top of search engine results when potential customers are searching for cannabis products in their area.</p>



<p>For example, Google uses a number of factors to determine the ranking of search results, including the number and quality of reviews that a dispensary has received. This means that a cannabis dispensary with a high rating and a large number of positive reviews is more likely to rank higher in search results, making it easier for potential customers to find the dispensary and learn more about the products and services it offers.</p>



<p>In addition to increased visibility, reputation management and positive reviews can also help to improve a cannabis dispensary&#8217;s SEO. When a dispensary has a large number of positive reviews, it’s more likely to generate a higher volume of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=organic+traffic&amp;oq=organic+traffic&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l9.3423j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">organic traffic</a> from search engines. This can help to drive more traffic to the dispensary&#8217;s website and increase the chances of generating leads and sales.</p>



<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Improved Customer Service and Satisfaction</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Reputation management and positive reviews can also help to improve customer service and satisfaction for cannabis businesses. When a business receives positive feedback from customers, it’s more likely to take the time to address any concerns or issues that customers may have. This can help to improve the overall customer experience and increase customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>For example, a study conducted by <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/the-five-disciplines-of-customer-experience-leaders/">Bain &amp; Company</a> found that businesses with a strong reputation are more likely to have customers who are willing to pay a premium for their products or services. This means that a cannabis business with a strong reputation and a high rating is more likely to be able to charge a higher price for its products and services, while still maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>Furthermore, positive reviews can help to identify areas where a cannabis business may need to improve. For example, if a business receives a number of negative reviews about a particular product or service, it can use that feedback to make changes and improve the customer experience.</p>



<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Finally, reputation management and positive reviews can help to give cannabis businesses a competitive advantage in the market. With so many cannabis businesses to choose from, customers are likely to choose a business with a strong reputation and high rating over one with a poor reputation and low rating.</p>



<p>For example, a study conducted by the <a href="http://www.wp5thstar.com">5th Star</a> found that businesses with a strong reputation are more likely to attract and retain customers, employees, and investors. This means that a cannabis business with a strong reputation is more likely to be able to attract and retain customers, employees, and investors, giving it a competitive advantage in the market.</p>

<p></p>



<p>As the cannabis industry continues to grow and evolve, it’s becoming increasingly important for businesses to establish a strong online presence. A <a href="https://nachoagency.com/website-design/">professional cannabis website design</a> is not only a crucial tool for increasing sales and brand awareness, but it can also help build trust and credibility with customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The importance of a professional website in the cannabis industry</h2>



<p>According to a recent survey, nearly 75% of consumers use the internet to research products and services before making a purchase. This means that having a <a href="https://nachoagency.com/website-design/">well-designed website</a> is essential for attracting potential customers and converting them into loyal fans of your brand.</p>



<p>In addition to providing information about your products and services, a professional website can also serve as a platform for engaging with customers and building a community around your brand. By regularly updating your <a href="https://nachoagency.com/website-design/">website</a> with blog posts, <a href="https://nachoagency.com/cannabis-videography/">videos</a>, and other <a href="https://nachoagency.com/">content</a>, you can establish yourself as a trusted authority in the cannabis industry and establish a loyal following.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Examples of successful cannabis brands with strong online presences</h2>



<p>One of the biggest cannabis brands, <a href="https://medmen.com/">MedMen</a>, has spent millions of dollars on their <a href="https://medmen.com/">website</a>, which features a sleek and modern design, detailed product information, and a user-friendly online shopping experience. This level of investment in their website has helped <a href="https://medmen.com/">MedMen</a> establish a strong online presence and attract customers from across the country.</p>



<p>Another way that cannabis businesses can increase sales and brand awareness through their website is by implementing effective search engine optimization (SEO) strategies. By optimizing your website for search engines, you can increase its visibility in search results and make it easier for potential customers to find your business.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key factors for optimizing your website for search engines and social media</h2>



<p>Some key factors to consider when optimizing your website for search engines include using relevant keywords in your website’s content, optimizing your website’s loading speed, and ensuring that it’s mobile-friendly. By implementing these strategies, you can improve your website’s search engine rankings and drive more traffic to your site.</p>



<p>In addition to SEO, another effective strategy for increasing sales and brand awareness through your website is by implementing a robust social media marketing campaign. By regularly posting <a href="https://nachoagency.com/home/">engaging content</a> on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, you can drive traffic to your website and increase your brand’s visibility online.</p>



<p>One cannabis brand that has effectively leveraged social media marketing is <a href="https://www.tgscolorado.com/">The Green Solution</a>. The company has built a strong presence on social media platforms, with over 30,000 followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/my.greensolution/">Instagram</a>, and regularly posts engaging content that drives traffic to their website and increases brand awareness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations for cannabis websites</h2>



<p>Another important factor to consider when building a professional website for your cannabis business is ensuring that it complies with <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/cannabis-laws/laws-and-regulations/">state and federal regulations</a>. With the legal landscape for cannabis constantly evolving, it’s essential that your website follows all relevant laws and regulations, including age restrictions and advertising guidelines.</p>



<p>By working with a <a href="https://nachoagency.com/website-design/">professional web design and development team</a> that has experience in the cannabis industry, you can ensure that your website complies with all relevant regulations and provides a safe and secure online shopping experience for your customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion: The benefits of investing in a professional website for your cannabis business</h2>



<p>In conclusion, a professional website is an essential tool for increasing sales and brand awareness in the cannabis industry. By implementing effective SEO and social media marketing strategies, regularly updating your website with engaging <a href="https://nachoagency.com/cannabis-photography/">Photos</a> and <a href="https://nachoagency.com/cannabis-videography/">Videos</a>, and ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations, you can build a strong online presence and attract customers from across the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the last several years, I’ve been personally consulting certain cannabis and hemp businesses to help them grow and succeed in the fascinating world of marketing and advertising in their respective industries. I take tremendous pride in connecting clients with the right partners depending on their specific goals, budget, and offerings — being able to make informed decisions based on the organic data collected by the Nacho team — and ultimately ensuring clients waste as little time and money as possible.</p>



<p>As an award-winning, full-service cannabis creative agency, we work with a number of different advertisers from all over the globe. These advertisers’ services range from display ads and social media, to billboards in major national/international cities, and much more.</p>



<p>Read on as I describe the types of ways in which we engage with our advertising partners, while also shining a light on some of our favorite advertisers we’ve been working with in 2021.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Does a Cannabis Marketing Agency like Nacho Engage with Advertising Partners?</h2>



<p>At Nacho, we offer services such as logo design, branding, website design, website development, social media, SEO, blogging, email marketing and content creation. In a nu tshell: we can help clients create their entire marketing platforms (from scratch!) and manage their day-to-day organic marketing efforts, strategy and traffic.</p>



<p>Our esteemed cannabis advertising partners have the ability to utilize the tools and platforms we provide clients, in order to target audiences based on our clients’ budgets, goals, services and demographics. Subsequently, this allows the client to accomplish important goals such as increasing traffic to their websites, generating leads and growing their social media following.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who Have Been Our Favorite Cannabis Advertising Partners This Year?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.leafly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leafly</a>&nbsp;– As a lot of our readers already know, Leafly is one of the most renowned cannabis education tools on the planet. In addition to their world-class cannabis SEO, they offer targeted advertising packages such as banner ads, article features, email marketing, and social media campaigns. Their ability to target demographics and drive valuable traffic to clients’ websites is remarkable.</p>



<p><a href="https://broccolimag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Broccoli Magazine</a>&nbsp;– Female founded and operated, Broccoli Mag is one of our favorite magazines on the planet, providing an elevated and trusted educational/visual experience. Unlike traditional advertisers, Broccoli is unique because they are able to target their niche fan base through their social media, podcast and newsletter channels.</p>



<p><a href="https://theemeraldmagazine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emerald Magazine</a>&nbsp;– Sprouting from the reaction to being a victim of the War on Drugs, Emerald Mag is another female-founded trusted media outlet in the cannabis and hemp sphere. They offer customized packages that boost website traffic and help with SEO, including article features, social media campaigns, newsletter, and banner ads.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.jambase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JamBase</a>&nbsp;– If you’re a live music enthusiast, you’ve probably already heard of JamBase. We love using their banner, social and email channels to promote our cannabis and CBD clients to music lovers. Everyone knows that music and cannabis go hand-in-hand, and so it’s very valuable to be able to target consumers based on their music preference, location and recent live concert experiences.</p>



<p><a href="https://creativetrnd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Creative TRND</a>&nbsp;– What else can we say, we love working with the Creative TRND team! Not only are they amazing content creators (especially video), but they’re also extremely helpful when it comes to social media advertising. As you all may know, social media is very tricky in regards&nbsp; to cannabis and hemp. We’re grateful we have a partner like Creative TRND who can help us navigate those waters and push a lot of our clients’ hemp ads on social media.</p>



<p><a href="https://herb.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Herb&nbsp;</a>– If you’re into being entertained and educated about cannabinoids on the day-to-day, then you must already follow Herb! We’ve been working with this media outlet for years. In regards to ads, emails, social media, articles, content creation and more, Herb is one of our favorite ad partners to work with. Their customer services and attention to detail are unmatched.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.greenscreens.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GreenScreens</a>&nbsp;– We’ve been collaborating with the GreenScreens team for years now. They offer digital advertising at the point of sale on digital menu boards within dispensaries. Their services provide great opportunities for both brands and dispensaries, while integrating with some of the best data and POS systems in the world.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJgC72WQy8KmNkWD8IzuUA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growers Network</a>&nbsp;– On top of being an educational directory and forum for over 17,000 members, the Growers Network are the founders of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GrowersNetwork/featured" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CannaCribs</a>&nbsp;and a number of other cannabis-related organizations. They have an&nbsp;<em>unreal</em>&nbsp;YouTube following, so they offer a valuable brand awareness opportunity for cannabis and hemp organizations to get eyes on their logos. We love working on their social media and getting clients and others involved with their episode launches.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Can We Help Grow Your Business?</h3>



<p>Let Nacho&#8217;s experience, skills and partnerships help you succeed in the tricky marketing and advertising landscapes of the cannabis and hemp spaces. We’re here to help you succeed and we understand what it takes to build a successful business from the bottom-up. We want to know your story, your goals and your limitations, so we can customize a program that works for <em>you</em>!</p>

<p>Recently, the state of California frustrated cannabis businesses by banning cannabis billboards, however there are some&nbsp;<a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/how-cannabis-companies-can-benefit-from-programmatic-digital-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positives about the situation</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>If anything, the legislation, which banned marijuana ads on any interstate or state highway crossing California’s 1,900-mile border (including some of the nation’s busiest highways, such as U.S. 101, Interstate 10, I-5, I-80, I-15 and I-40) highlighted what we already know.</em></p>



<p>And “what we already know”, is this: among other factors, the future of California cannabis marketing (and beyond) is in programmatic digital advertising, and decidedly&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;in things such as physical billboard marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital marketing not only ensures that your content and message is seen throughout various related sites—but it also makes real time targeting optimization possible—and so savvy cannabis brands will do well to implement this marketing method today and moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">California Cannabis Sales Keep Breaking Records</h2>



<p>As a testament to the staying power of cannabis in the Golden State, the recent data concerning sales numbers shows the state “shattering” the previous tax revenue records in the latest fiscal year. California&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/california-shattered-marijuana-tax-revenue-record-in-latest-fiscal-year-state-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collected a whopping $817 million</a>&nbsp;in tax revenue during the 2020-21 period, which is a head-spinning 55% increase from the previous year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact that this is happening during the Covid-19 pandemic also speaks to the essential status of cannabis, both in the eyes of the government and in the hearts and minds of California citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Catching Up With Some of Our Cali Cannabis &amp; Hemp Clients:</h2>



<p>We’re lucky to work with some of the best cannabis and hemp companies/brands in California.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New Ideas We Gathered from Testing 200+ Cannabis Products</h2>



<p>The past few years have brought significant growth to the cannabis industry. Small businesses and large corporations have begun to establish themselves – transitioning their audience and products into this developing market. Many celebrities/influencers have launched their own cannabis products or collaborated with existing companies to create luxury cannabis brands.</p>



<p>This boom in the industry has caused a beneficial impact in more ways than one; sales numbers in the global cannabis packaging market are estimated to reach&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4897093/cannabis-packaging-market-growth-trends-covid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly $300 billion USD by 2026</a>. With that projection, various lines of products and packaging designs for cannabis have emerged throughout the years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Thriving Potential of the Cannabis Market</h2>



<p>More and more states throughout the country have turned to the legalization of medical and recreational cannabis.</p>



<p>Currently,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">36 of the 50 states</a>&nbsp;have fully legalized cannabis to be cultivated, packaged, prescribed medically, and distributed to dispensaries. This increased demand has in turn allowed a variety of products to reach diverse audiences, depending on their choice of consumption. Whether we’re talking edibles, topicals, flower, vapes (or cartridges), concentrates, pre-rolls, and everything in between — nowadays it seems there is a product out there that has the potential to match the needs of&nbsp;<em>every&nbsp;</em>consumer.</p>



<p>Today’s most-recognized cannabis companies owe their success to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/cannabis-cbd-packaging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong brand identity.</a>&nbsp;Both consistency in branding and positive first impressions from your customers are crucial in a market (such as the cannabis market) that continues to have thriving potential. With all the diverse options for cannabis products that are currently available, the packaging design going into these products certainly plays a powerful role in a company’s branding and target audience.</p>



<p>Branding design in cannabis packaging is important because it is the absolute first impression your customer sees of your project — ultimately defining its quality and value. Amidst a large pool of products crowding dispensary shelves in 2021, it is important to make sure that your packaging design stands out and appeals to your targeted audience. Numerous elements and details go into creating cannabis packages that align with your company’s products and values.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Design Diversity in Cannabis Packaging</h2>



<p>While we seem to always hear: “never judge a book by its cover,” packaging undoubtedly plays a vital role in the purchase of products — cannabis included.</p>



<p>Considering the huge strides the cannabis industry has made in such a short amount of time, product packaging design has come a long way. Not too long ago, cannabis products were designed using stark, bland and dull product packaging. However, now that the industry has gained competition, brands are compelled to create unique designs that stand out among the rest.</p>



<p>Successful product packaging is created by first understanding the type of customer you are targeting, and subsequently the unique experience you are marketing to that customer.&nbsp;<a href="https://cbdoracle.com/reviews/cannabis-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Many trending cannabis brands</a>&nbsp;have followed different styles and designs to promote their specific product and its intended experience. But, of course it’s not&nbsp;<em>just&nbsp;</em>about the style/design. There are a number of other factors that help elevate the packaging of a cannabis brand, including:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Compliance:</h2>



<p>Familiarizing its team with current cannabis laws should be the first step before starting the packaging design of any company.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Appealing to the&nbsp;<em>Right&nbsp;</em>Audience:</h3>



<p>This is a ‘no-brainer’, but of course, a company must know their customer base. Gender? Average age? Income level? Knowing who your customers&nbsp;<em>are</em>, will better help you create the perfect product for&nbsp;<em>them</em>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sharp Focus on the Effects and Overall Cannabis Experience:</h3>



<p>Cannabis (and the terms associated with it) can get confusing, especially to the average person. Thinking carefully about how to describe your product on the packaging will offer customers a clearer idea as to exactly what kind of product is being offered.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cannabis Product Testing Results:</h2>



<p>Obviously, you most likely won’t be able to fit an entire lab report on your design however, most companies have found success by providing a simple QR code on their packaging that customers are able to scan for access to pertinent information — including cannabinoid ratios, terpene profiles, known contaminants, etc. This offers customers transparency regarding the products which they are buying and consuming.</p>



<p>Another important factor to consider is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cannabis-packaging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustainable packaging</a>. In nearly every industry, wasteful packaging is an issue; a cannabis company that strives to provide sustainable solutions will differentiate itself from other companies who fail to embrace sustainable business practices. Also, as the world becomes more environmentally conscious, modern consumers are likely to gravitate towards such a brand — after all, cannabis packaging that is safe for the planet and the people, can only be a&nbsp;<em>good</em>&nbsp;thing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Luxury Cannabis Brands</h2>



<p>Luxury cannabis and CBD brands have created top-quality packaging to match their products, providing an elevated cannabis experience. Chic and minimal design layouts in cannabis packaging promote a sense of quality to ‘luxury’ consumers (who are expecting an exquisite product.) Pre-rolls and high-potency cannabis cultivars/strains tend to dominate the luxury cannabis market, as celebrities and influencers are finding new ways to infuse their creative style with cannabis brand partners.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Colors and Quality in Cannabis Packaging</h2>



<p>Two more key factors in cannabis packaging design are minimalism and authenticity. Products with attractive, colorful packaging tend to evoke intense activity in specific areas of the brain – in contrast to those with neutral packaging. It is common for cannabis brands to also show their commitment to sustainability through this type of product design, promoting a company mission of environmental consciousness and sustainable packaging alternatives.</p>



<p>Other types of cannabis packaging are designed solely to promote relief for medical cannabis patients. While qualifying conditions regarding medical cannabis eligibility vary by state, a specific style of branding and design is incorporated into these products to distinguish the benefits and purpose of use. Medical symbols on the packaging clearly mark the meaning of the product design, while clear and concise text is important to describe the details of the product and its risks, before use.</p>



<p>A more neutral design is used for medical cannabis products and packaging in order to distinguish the purpose and quality of the product for the customer. Although these products emphasize effectiveness and relief in their packaging, it is important to consult with a doctor about medical cannabis products to explore what works for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Message of Cannabis</h2>



<p>The best cannabis brands you will find today provide a balance of creative design and insightful information in the product packaging. And while the industry grows competitively, a strong brand identity can make a huge impact in the efforts to stand apart from the assorted established brands.</p>



<p>The elements that go into cannabis product packaging design play an important role in the customer’s reaction to the product, especially for beginners. Great packaging design will attract people to feel safer and more confident in the cannabis products they choose, even offering suggestions for use or tips and tricks on how and when to use their product. This is why most medical cannabis companies design products and packaging that clearly describes the benefits of use in order to build a trusting connection with their customer.</p>



<p>With cannabis education, research and legalization constantly growing, it is crucial for consumers to fully understand the product information and purpose. Strong values and quality products compel companies to break the stigma of cannabis through unique and creative approaches to branding. Some brands even collaborate with nonprofit organizations to advocate for cannabis reform in order to help those who have been unjustly impacted by the criminalization of cannabis.</p>



<p>The voice and message behind each cannabis company should promote the product’s branding and packaging design, loud and clear.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Design Matters!</h3>



<p>No matter the intent or meaning behind these various cannabis products and brands — design matters. Package design that specifically markets to a targeted audience and accurately portrays the company’s product and mission will be most successful in this competitive industry.</p>



<p>As this industry continues to grow, there is so much potential for cannabis brands and companies to explore the many ways to attract and educate customers.</p>



<p>While products range from trendy and modern, to therapeutic and medicinal, product packaging is essentially the first impression customers will have regarding the product. Considering these elements and strategies in cannabis packaging design will help businesses succeed in their branding.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>When it comes to cannabis businesses – brand identities and packaging design play major roles in the cannabis market and its specific audience. As mentioned above, many factors go into the branding and packaging of companies, with so many diverse options of cannabis products available for consumers and the conscious creative effort behind each packaged design.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Cannabis Meets Design</h1>



<p>As the legalization of recreational cannabis ignites across the country, dispensaries are popping up in a shopping center near you creating heavy competition. Most dispensaries follow the Field of Dreams model, assuming that if they build a standard dispensary, consumers will come. While that is true for the first year or two in a legal market, dispensaries in older legal markets have found their sales decreasing in a “race to the bottom” on pricing because there’s nothing to separate them from their competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Business owners have free creative reign on most dispensary aesthetics under the guidance of state and local rules. The possibilities have opened a new world of cannabis retail design. From a posh ambiance with a luxury in-store experience to a serene, botanical theme exuding wellness, cannabis shops are more than just your local pot stop.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.fresnobee.com/latest-news/wwp20m/picture255358451/alternates/FREE_1140/The%20Artist%20Tree-5.jpg" alt="Fresno, retail cannabis update. New permits, spring openings | The Fresno  Bee"/></figure>



<p>The majority of retailers agree that the customer experience is a top priority. Whether big or small, dispensaries that make customers feel welcomed and motivated to shop are heavily influenced by design.   </p>



<p>Whether you’re opening your first dispensary or looking at a brand refresh to drive more sales, take a look at these emerging dispensary design trends and tips on how to find the style that best suits your customers’ needs.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Bigger is Better</h1>



<p>The global pandemic has reshaped the traditional in-store shopping experience.  National retail trends predict an increase in online sales between 18 percent and 23 percent before 2022.  The demand for faster, digital purchasing options has sparked a hybrid of innovative online browsing and interactive retail experiences to best suit shoppers from any device or location. </p>



<p>As customer shopping habits evolve, cannabis retailers have seized the opportunity to exceed customer expectations. A growing number of dispensaries provide delivery services and shop online, pick up in-store options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the ultimate goal is to increase your average sale per customer. This is most often achieved through suggestive selling and impulse purchases that are best accomplished in the store. But how to get customers to walk through your doors?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many dispensaries lure customers into the store through special loyalty program discounts and over-the-top entertainment. Located steps away from the Las Vegas Strip,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.planet13lasvegas.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Planet 13</a>’s 110,000 square foot complex resembles a mini-mall. Customers can shop cannabis and watch it being made all while grabbing a cup of coffee or bite to eat. A colossal planet-shaped water sculpture greets and entices customers from the parking lot. Inside, premium cannabis products of cosmic proportions awaits. No other dispensary in the world offers such a wide selection of cannabis products. Nearly 100 budtenders (there are interactive displays too) are on standby ready to teach eager patrons about the more than 100 cannabis items offered in-store.&nbsp; Although this store never closes, the customer experience includes online orders and delivery up to midnight with order tracking.</p>



<p>While there is a nationwide trend towards larger dispensaries, those in major cities or more densely populated states, don’t have the luxury of space that Nevada does. So it’s important to focus on what will resonate with your audience and to make the best use of space that you have through your store layout.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Exploring Layouts</h1>



<p>Creating a fluid flow of traffic is an important part of a dispensary design layout. Customers should easily see and access checkout areas and cannabis items. Each step a customer takes from entry to exit may be carefully crafted by a layout design. Consider the following paths for the ultimate cannabis shopping experience.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img decoding="async" src="https://maryjanemarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-24-at-9.23.26-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8949"/></figure></div>



<p>Grid Path — Products are displayed in aisles. This layout is ideal for a larger dispensary with a high volume of cannabis items. For instance, customers at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.planet13lasvegas.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Planet 13</a>&nbsp;in Las Vegas and its newest California location stroll through rows of the world’s largest selection of cannabis.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://maryjanemarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dispensary-Design-Trends-Planet-13-300x200.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8938"/></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img decoding="async" src="https://maryjanemarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-24-at-9.24.39-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8951"/></figure></div>



<p>Free Flow Path — Customers are able to browse freely and leisurely.&nbsp; This layout is ideal for small cannabis shops with limited space and inventory or dispensaries seeking a more personalized approach.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://shopserra.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Serra</a>&nbsp;uses the free flow path to make all guests, from the curious novice to expert users, feel welcomed.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img decoding="async" src="https://maryjanemarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-24-at-9.25.38-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8952"/></figure></div>



<p>Loop Path — The most restrictive layout where customers follow a uniform, one-way path through product displays to the checkout. This layout allows customers to browse all products, without skipping through merchandise. This layout is ideal for any size dispensary.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://liquidchrome.ca/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liquid Chrome</a>&nbsp;glass structures form a loop path to direct guests in a set direction throughout its multi-level store.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Designer Displays</h1>



<p>Even a small cannabis shop can pack a punch with attention-grabbing displays.&nbsp; There are many options available to exhibit cannabis accessories and infused products. Whether you prefer an upright showcase, open shelving units, counter-height displays, or a combination of each, the most important aspect is that all merchandise is locked and properly stored.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Glass cases are currently trending in cannabis retail. Customers can easily view items and glass cases can easily be customized with metal, wood or natural stone to elevate any design.&nbsp; Canada’s&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://liquidchrome.ca/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liquid Chrome</a>&nbsp;is more than just cool on the outside, the X factor transcends across 4 levels and over 6,000 square feet. The store’s wall-to-wall glass exhibit mirrors a carnival glass house, where customers walk through a maze of glass pipes, lighters and smokeware.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dispensaries have also found unique ways to group premium cannabis products. As seen in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://liquidchrome.ca/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liquid Chrome</a>, go upward to a higher level and guests can access exclusive items. Donned in velvet ropes, Level 2 rolls out the red carpet with the best of the best selection in the industry.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://maryjanemarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dispensary-Design-Trends_Liquid-Chrome-300x225.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8941"/></figure></div>



<p>Other strategies include featured products by brand or by the type of strain and their effects. At&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://shopserra.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Serra</a>, cannabis is grouped into six desired sensations, described as feelings. Vaporizers, flowers and pre-rolls are arranged in house-shaped metal and glass terrarium displays. The custom showcase gives an obvious nod to its namesake.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://maryjanemarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dispensary-Design-Trends-Serra-300x200.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8942"/></figure></div>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Lighting Trends</h1>



<p>Lighting is more than bland, fluorescent bulbs, it is a mood changer. Gone are the days of hideous fluorescent lighting creating a bland and boring palette. Cannabis retailers are reimagining lighting to enhance customer experience.&nbsp; From swanky chandeliers creating a high-life atmosphere to rustic pendants for industrial vibes, innovative lighting can sway customers to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://gnelectricinc.com/lighting-increase-sales/" rel="noreferrer noopener">shop longer&nbsp;</a>and ultimately increase purchases.</p>



<p>There is a myriad of lighting sources to amplify your design theme.&nbsp; Standard lighting may be sufficient for general areas, however a combination of different lighting levels and fixtures can change the tone of a cannabis retail space.</p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://eufloracolorado.com/locations/16th-st-mall/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Euflora</a>’s Downtown Denver location lighting design pays homage to the city’s art and culture scene.&nbsp; With the use of track lighting, urban art featuring local artists comes to life.&nbsp; LED lighting illuminates display boxes to draw customers towards new and best-selling cannabis products. Hanging glass pendants, modern ring lights and eye-catching neon signs embellish the checkout area, increasing visibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Natural lighting from large display windows paired with heightened, exposed ceilings and warm wood tone floors, as seen in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://shopserra.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Serra</a>’s Portland-based store, is the perfect combination for a natural ambiance.&nbsp; The cannabis vendor looked within its own name (which means greenhouse in Italian) to select its design. Inspired by its mission to transform the way people look at cannabis, the popular dispensary features a plant wall and lush greenery creating a calm, pure and stress-free environment. Smart lighting and mirror panels are also a great resource to mimic the outdoors if faced with limited space or natural lighting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Want a dark and moody aura? To create a dramatic space, think high-end jewelry stores, accent lighting is key.&nbsp; Focal-point lights throughout the retail floor can be used to showcase rare and expensive cannabis strains. Make your shelving and display cases beam with LED light strips or choose dimmers to create a soft glow. Keep in mind that employee break rooms and bathrooms are often a missed opportunity to add unique lighting decor.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Storefront Do’s and Don’ts</h1>



<p>The first interaction with a customer happens before they walk inside a dispensary.&nbsp; Having an enticing storefront is essential to starting off on the right foot. A bold pop of color or unique art mural grabs the attention of those passing by. Large, engaging window displays leave them wanting more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take a drive through downtown Barrie in Ontario, Canada and you are sure to notice&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://liquidchrome.ca/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liquid Chrome</a>. An all-black brick facade and chrome silver trimmings give this notorious shop an instant edgy, yet modern look.&nbsp; Rather than blend in, its monochromatic exterior stands out within the business district, piquing passersby’s curiosity. Through large glass windows decorated in stark white graphics, customers are enticed by colorful displays of limited-edition merchandise and a peek at a seemingly endless selection of glass smoking accessories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are the top 5 do’s and don’ts to keep customers wanting to walk through your doors over again.</p>



<ol><li>DO: Keep the exterior clean and refreshed.</li><li>DO: Maintain landscaping for clear visibility.</li><li>DONT: Clutter your window displays. Keep it simple.</li><li>DO: Have proper lighting to enhance security.</li><li>DON’T: Block pedestrian traffic or store entrance. Ensure all planters, trash receptacles, sidewalk signage or other outdoor displays do not impede traffic flow.</li></ol>



<p>Always check your state and local ordinances for merchandise display and advertising guidelines. Some regulations may ban the use of cannabis images and cannabis products visibility from the street, which impacts your storefront windows.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Get Access</h1>



<p>Your customer experience and store design process not only rely on how you look but where you are located. Is your dispensary located on a highly congested one-way street with no street parking available?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>High traffic areas may be great for visibility, but not so desirable for customers attempting to safely park and visit. Don’t let bad parking options or limited accessibility turn potential customers away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider the following transportation options to help guide your design choices to attract the customers you want.</p>



<ul><li>Walk up – how many of the target audience live within walking distance?&nbsp;</li><li>Bike – is there bike parking available?&nbsp;</li><li>Drive – what are the parking options in the area? Is it handicap accessible?&nbsp;</li><li>Public Transportation – is the location accessible to public transportation? How far does a customer have to travel to reach you from public transportation?&nbsp;</li><li>Rideshare – are there rideshare options nearby?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>How will your store be set up to handle different types of customers from the newbie who needs a consultation to the experienced user who needs to restock? Will you offer pickup and is there another location for pickup or delivery drivers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wayfinding describes how a person is able to navigate using signs. Having signage at the right place where people will look for direction is an important part. From age verification to merchandise to menus and checkout areas, signage is extremely important to help the flow of traffic both inside and out of your store.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">The Customer is Always Right</h1>



<p>Which design is best for your business? The simplest answer is the one that fits your customers the best and that will make you stand out from the rest! There is no one size fits all design for cannabis retail and unique stores will be rewarded with sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to success is knowing who you are as a business. Determine what you want your dispensary to achieve, including the customers you want to serve. Are you focused on cannabis for health and wellness? Or, do you desire to bring an upscale experience to your community with exclusive cannabis products? Do you have the dankest bud that experience consumers crave?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Know your audience, solidify your key values and ensure that these are incorporated into your dispensary retail design.&nbsp;</p>
